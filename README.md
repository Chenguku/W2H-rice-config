# Welcome2Heaven's fun-colorful-rice

**Note:** I have currently updated nibar so that it is functional for Apple Silicon Macs (at least in Sonoma 14.5.) No other changes have been made thus far. Refer to the original README for instructions.

I am currently looking to add yabai windows to the nibar layout, or try to replicate it using sketchybar. I am very new to github and unix configuration so any help/advice is greatly appreciated!
