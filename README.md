# Welcome2Heaven's fun-colorful-rice

**Note:** I have currently updated the nibar config so that the date & time widget is functional for Apple Silicon Macs (tested in Sonoma 14.5+.) Otherwise, only minor changes have been made.

**Directions:** Refer to the original README for instructions.

Currently planning to either add yabai windows to the nibar layout to try to replicate the layout using sketchybar.

I am very new to github and unix configuration so any help/advice is greatly appreciated!
